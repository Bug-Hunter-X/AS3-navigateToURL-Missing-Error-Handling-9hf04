# AS3 navigateToURL Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in ActionScript 3: the lack of error handling when using the `navigateToURL` function.  The `bug.as` file shows the problematic code, which fails silently if the navigation fails.  The `bugSolution.as` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling, demonstrating best practices.
